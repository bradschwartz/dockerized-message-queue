# Multi-Language Messaging System Test

Goal: Run multiple Docker containers, where each will:
  - Run it's own pub/sub messaging system
  - Single, unique language (MVP: Python, Golang | Reach: Scala (Utilizing Java))
  - Coordinate from single space (MVP: compose | Reach: swarm, kubernetes)

## Architecture

MVP:
- [ ]  (2) Python/Golang Containers -  pub/sub
- [x]  (1) Docker Container - MQ server, above connect to
- [ ]  (1) docker-compose.yml - Define containers, ports, hosts by name for containers
Reach:
- [ ]  (1) Scala/JVM Container -  pub/sub
- [ ]  (1) Database Container - History of comms
